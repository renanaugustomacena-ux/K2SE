"""Read/write data/k2se_addresses.csv -- K2SE's address table.

The CSV is the single source of truth for every address K2SE did not derive by
hand. src/offsets_generated.h is produced from it and must never be edited
directly.

Columns
-------
kind         function | global | offset | constant
class        owning class, or "Other" for free functions
name         member name
value        hex, 0x-prefixed
provenance   where the value came from:
               kpm-db      Kotor-Patch-Manager kotor2_steam_aspyr.db
               k2se-ghidra our own Ghidra project
verified_by  how it was checked ON THIS BINARY:
               prologue    entry point is in .text and starts with 55 8B EC
               callsite    reached via the rel32 of a verified E8 in a real handler
               disasm      the function body was read and understood
               runtime     exercised in a live game session
               unverified  imported but not yet checked -- never call these
notes        free text

A row's `verified_by` is a claim about *this* executable, not about the source it
came from. Nothing marked `unverified` may be called from shipping code.
