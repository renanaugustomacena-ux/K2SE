// Turning a script OBJECT id into a live game object.
//
// This is the boundary where K2SE stops being self-contained. Everything up to
// now touched addresses whose meaning was established by disassembling this
// executable. Here we also rely on STRUCT OFFSETS -- claims about an object's
// runtime layout that cannot be checked by reading the file, only by being
// right. They were imported from a third-party database whose KOTOR 2 rows were
// auto-ported from another build.
//
// So the posture is different from the rest of K2SE: assume every pointer might
// be wrong. Each hop is range-checked, every dereference runs under a structured
// exception handler, and a failure returns a sentinel the script can test
// instead of taking the game down. A creature accessor that returns "I don't
// know" is recoverable; one that reads a wild pointer is not.

// This exists because of a specific failure. On 2026-08-29 five routines
// returned -1 five times and wrote not one line explaining any of them, because
// every refusal in this file was a bare `return nullptr`. The chain was in fact
// healthy; nothing in the log could say so. Silence was the bug.
//
// It reports TRANSITIONS, not calls. The callers ride a creature heartbeat, so a
// line per call would bury the log -- instead a line is written the first time
// an outcome is seen and every time the outcome CHANGES, closing the previous
// run with how long it lasted. A healthy session costs one line. The session
// described above would have cost three, and been diagnosed from them.
//
// `who` names the calling routine, so the log says which of 881-884 asked.
